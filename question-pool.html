<h1>Question Pool</h1>
<p>The purpose of this site is to collect all kinds of missing topics that should be added to this wiki.</p>
<p>'''Feel free to add whatever you like'''.</p>
<h2>Topics to add:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Station &amp; Ship Editor</li>
  <li>Station Sizes</li>
  <li>What can you do with a station? Big stations are possible (seen at the kickstarter video), but how do you “fill” them? What makes them big? It’S not just empty space?!</li>
  <li>Ship Production Facilities? How? How big?</li>
  <li>Ship Components: Thruster, Weapons, Hardpoints; How is it build generally?</li>
  <li>Upgrade Ship / Station Components: How will it be handled?</li>
  <li>Zillion different tech states (of one module): How will it be organized, how to keep the general view?</li>
  <li>Will the game be released on steam? Will it use the steam cloud? (Likely on Steam, and through the LT website)</li>
  <li>Settings: It seems that there are going to be a lot of settings. Will they be saved in a cloud (steam for example) or are they able to be exported? What can be changed within the settings?</li>
  <li>Which kind of OREs will be in LT? I've seen Viritium, Altchite, Gamnite, Islockite (depends on universe)</li>
  <li>RTS tactical interface (done till beta)</li>
  <li>Sensors (Page needs more info)</li>
  <li>Shields (Page needs more info)</li>
  <li>Weapons (Page needs more info)</li>
  <li>The "Development Overview page has a lot of links to non-existent pages, I'm filling those out but help is appreciated. Just a little stub is fine, we don't know all that much details anyway…</li>
  <li>Has goal of 100+ ships been met?</li>
  <li>Roles of Executive vs Worker AI</li>
  <li>cargo/inventory interface /cargo transfer</li>
