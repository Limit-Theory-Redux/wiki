<h1>Blueprint Copy</h1>
<p>An assembly chip is an item used in production.<br>An assembly chip is created from a <a href="http://limit-theory.wikidot.com/blueprint">blueprint</a>. An assembly chip is essentially a "crafting recipe"; you need an assembly chip together with the correct resources to produce an object. The assembly chip is consumed in the process.<br>The idea behind this is that the original technology creator has the (unique) <a href="http://limit-theory.wikidot.com/blueprint">blueprint</a>, and can use that to create assembly chips, which can then be used or sold.<br>The <a href="http://limit-theory.wikidot.com/blueprint">blueprint</a> can then be considered as some form of patent, and an assembly as a limited use production license.</p>
