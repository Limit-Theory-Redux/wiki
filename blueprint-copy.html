<h1>Blueprint Copy</h1>
<p>A Blueprint Copy is an item used in production.<br>A Blueprint Copy is created from a <a href="/blueprint">blueprint</a>. A Blueprint Copy is essentially a "crafting recipe"; you need a Blueprint Copy together with the correct resources to produce an object. The Blueprint Copy has a limited life span that expires after a set number of hours. In the case of contracted work a Blueprint Copy is consumed when the order has been completed or when its timer expires, whichever comes first.<br>The idea behind this is that the original technology creator has the (unique) <a href="/blueprint">blueprint</a>, and can use that to create Blueprint Copies, which can then be used or sold on the <a href="/market">market</a>.<br>The <a href="/blueprint">blueprint</a> can then be considered as some form of patent, and an assembly as a limited use production license.</p>
