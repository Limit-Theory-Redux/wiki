<h1>Contract</h1>
<p>A contract is an action a player can perform for which they will get paid.<br>Contracts are posted by the AI (or the player) when they want something done. They also have to allot a budget to the contract.<br>Unlike most games, in LT missions aren't necessarily discrete things (like destroy ship X) but more things like "do damage to assets belonging to faction X" where the amount the player (or the AI) gets paid is proportional to the amount of damage they inflict.</p>
