<p>The community is creating the soundtrack for the Limit Theory Redux. &nbsp;Most notably MesoTroniK and IllustrisJack have produced amazing scores which are currently being used in the game. &nbsp;The goal of the soundtrack is to be dynamic and adapt to the player's actions (music changes in combat etc) in a way that's more advanced to the standard fade.</p>
