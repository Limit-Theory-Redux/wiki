# Question Pool

> This page will eventually moved to the Discord as all discussions are done over there.
{.is-warning}


The purpose of this site is to collect all kinds of missing topics that should be added to this wiki.

'''Feel free to add whatever you like'''.

## Topics to add:

-   Station & Ship Editor
-   Ship Production Facilities? How? How big? - Station sized, link to Production page
-   Ship Components: Thruster, Weapons, Hardpoints; How is it build generally?
-   Upgrade Ship / Station Components: How will it be handled?
-   Zillion different tech states (of one module): How will it be organized, how to keep the general view?
-   Will the game be released on steam? Will it use the steam cloud? (Likely on Steam, possibly on Github)
-   Settings: It seems that there are going to be a lot of settings. Will they be saved in a cloud (steam for example) or are they able to be exported? What can be changed within the settings? (have to wait till closer to release to answer this.)
-   Sensors (Page needs more info)
-   Shields (Page needs more info)
-   Weapons (Page needs more info)
-   The "Development Overview page has a lot of links to non-existent pages
-   Has goal of 100+ ships been met? - Yes, though I'm unsure on exact numbers
-   Roles of Executive vs Worker AI - This is outdated.  A page on AI is needed.
-   cargo/inventory interface /cargo transfer - This is something that needs to be made.
