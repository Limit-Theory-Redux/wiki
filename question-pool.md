# Question Pool

> This page will eventually moved to the Discord as all discussions are done over there.
{.is-warning}


The purpose of this site is to collect all kinds of missing topics that should be added to this wiki.

'''Feel free to add whatever you like'''.

## Topics to add:

-   Station & Ship Editor
-   Station Sizes
-   What can you do with a station? Big stations are possible (seen at the kickstarter video), but how do you “fill” them? What makes them big? It’S not just empty space?!
-   Ship Production Facilities? How? How big?
-   Ship Components: Thruster, Weapons, Hardpoints; How is it build generally?
-   Upgrade Ship / Station Components: How will it be handled?
-   Zillion different tech states (of one module): How will it be organized, how to keep the general view?
-   Will the game be released on steam? Will it use the steam cloud? (Likely on Steam, and through the LT website)
-   Settings: It seems that there are going to be a lot of settings. Will they be saved in a cloud (steam for example) or are they able to be exported? What can be changed within the settings?
-   Which kind of OREs will be in LT? I've seen Viritium, Altchite, Gamnite, Islockite (depends on universe)
-   RTS tactical interface (done till beta)
-   Sensors (Page needs more info)
-   Shields (Page needs more info)
-   Weapons (Page needs more info)
-   The "Development Overview page has a lot of links to non-existent pages, I'm filling those out but help is appreciated. Just a little stub is fine, we don't know all that much details anyway…
-   Has goal of 100+ ships been met?
-   Roles of Executive vs Worker AI
-   cargo/inventory interface /cargo transfer
