<h1>Production</h1>
<p>The production process starts in one of two ways, either on the research screen where a blueprint can be created, or when a <a href="/blueprint">blueprint</a> is purchased from the <a href="/market">market</a>. &nbsp;The blueprint itself can be used in production, though this is not recommended, or can be used to create a <a href="/blueprint-copy">Blueprint Copy</a> each of which have a player defined time limit. &nbsp;A Blueprint Copy is then sent to a factory along with given resources for production.</p>
