<p>Power Distribution allows the player to change the energy settings on various ship systems. This means that energy from the engines can be routed to one or more energy weapons to increase the weapon's rate of fire or damage depending on the type of weapon. In the same way energy could be taken from energy weapons and given to engines which would increase the speed of the ship.</p>
