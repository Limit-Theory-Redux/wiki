<h1>Shields</h1>
<p>There are several different types of shields in Limit Theory. Each shield is powered by a single generator and ships can have multiple shields and shield types. Loose shields are best used against larger ships as they provide substantial protection against incoming fire but allow enemy ships to pass underneath them. Tight shields prevent enemy ships from passing under them, but they don't offer as much protection against incoming fire. Shields do not show up visually unless they are absorbing damage. Besides visual cues, if a shielded ship is scanned the type of shield will appear to emit its unique energy signature.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Loose shields: creates a strong energy field bubble around the ship.</li>
  <li>Tight shields: creates a weak energy field right over the surface of the ship</li>
</ul>
