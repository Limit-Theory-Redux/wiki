<h1>Station</h1>
<p>Stations are large stationary objects that act as points of interest within a star system as they offer a location to conduct trade and other important interactions. &nbsp;A station represents a centralized hub for the economy. &nbsp;While docked at a station a ship can change its loadout, buy and sell equipment, ships, and other goods as well as create and accept contracts.</p>
<p>Some stations also offer inventory space that can be rented and used to store an assortment of valuables which can be retrieved later.</p>
<p>Stations are owned by a faction and are often used to stake a claim on the surrounding area. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Stations can be equipped with different modules. &nbsp;These modules require large volumes to operate efficiently. &nbsp;Some examples of modules include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Research and Development labs</li>
  <li>Factories</li>
  <li>Item Storage</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
