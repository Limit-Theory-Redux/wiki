<h1>Weapons</h1>
<p>There are a number of types of weapons in Limit Theory. Each has it's own pros and cons associated with itself. Weapons have certain levels which correspond with the mounts on different ships. Weapons receive their properties from technologies which are researched. Factions create the technology which in turn creates the item.</p>
<p>Missile and ballistic weapons are both ammo dependent and have two inherent rates of fire associated with them. The fire rate of the individual projectiles and the magazine<br>reloading time. This allows a volley of missiles to be fired all at once but with the negative side effect of a longer reload.</p>
<p>Energy weapons are not ammo dependent but take away from a ship's energy supply resulting in lower performance of certain systems.</p>
