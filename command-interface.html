<h1>Command Interface</h1>
<p>The Command Interface (also known as the RTS Interface) allows the player to command and control multiple owned ships. In this view the AI can be given movement, attack, and follow orders. While the player can move about freely in the interface, visual range is limited to the sensor range of owned ships. The Command Interface has two view modes, a Holo-View where objects are semi-transparent and a Live View where the universe can be seen as it is from the first person view.</p>
